 * @{
 * AVBufferPool is an API for a lock-free thread-safe pool of AVBuffers.
 *
 * Frequently allocating and freeing large buffers may be slow. AVBufferPool is
 * meant to solve this in cases when the caller needs a set of buffers of the
 * same size (the most obvious use case being buffers for raw video or audio
 * frames).
 *
 * At the beginning, the user must call av_buffer_pool_init() to create the
 * buffer pool. Then whenever a buffer is needed, call av_buffer_pool_get() to
 * get a reference to a new buffer, similar to av_buffer_alloc(). This new
 * reference works in all aspects the same way as the one created by
 * av_buffer_alloc(). However, when the last reference to this buffer is
 * unreferenced, it is returned to the pool instead of being freed and will be
 * reused for subsequent av_buffer_pool_get() calls.
 *
 * When the caller is done with the pool and no longer needs to allocate any new
 * buffers, av_buffer_pool_uninit() must be called to mark the pool as freeable.
 * Once all the buffers are released, it will automatically be freed.
 *
 * Allocating and releasing buffers with this API is thread-safe as long as
 * either the default alloc callback is used, or the user-supplied one is
 * thread-safe.
